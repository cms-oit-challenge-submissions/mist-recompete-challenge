# 02 Interface Updates

Based on internal input, the business has decided to make several changes to the application including:

- The "Manage inventory" button on the main menu should be moved to the 2nd item
- Inventory list items should display with subtotal first to 3 decimal places, then quantity, and then name
- The order of rows on the checkout page should be reversed, starting with check out buttons, then subtotals, and finally the item list and selections
- The "Save" and "Delete" buttons on the edit dialog should be moved above the item fields
- The quantity field on the edit dialog should be moved to the bottom of the item fields
